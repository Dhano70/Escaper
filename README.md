# escaper-product-dynamics
This a Product Dynamics project and describes the software for an autonomous “escaper” robot. The robot drives independently, measures its speed using encoders, controls it with a PID controller, and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic distance sensor. Using an Arduino UNO as the brain.
